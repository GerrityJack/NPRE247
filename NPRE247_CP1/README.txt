Run ThreeComponentDecayChain.py with input ThreeComponentDecayChainInput.txt. In the terminal, it looks like this:
python3 ThreeComponentDecayChain.py ThreeComponentDecayChainInput.txt

The input file should contain:
the two decay constants (lambda),
the inital number of each isotope (N_0),
the time after which isotope quantities are measured (t_final)
and the time incremented over (deltat)

The input file should be structured like so:
lambdaA
lambdaB
N_A0
N_B0
N_C0
deltat
T_final

The program will return the following results to an output file:
